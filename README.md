_NOTE:_ I have commented [CampaignControllerTest](https://github.com/umtbrbr/spring-boot-postgresql-example/blob/master/src/test/java/com/campaign/demo/controller/CampaignContollerTest.java) out class. I'm getting unknown host exception when I build app with mvn clean install. The reason is that I set container name of postgres to application.properties as below. I could not find a solution so I had to commented it out for now.

    #spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://10.166.22.127:5432/postgres
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://postgres:5432/postgres
